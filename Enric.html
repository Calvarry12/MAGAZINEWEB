    <h2>2008–2011: Career beginnings</h2>
    <p>Gil started acting in 2008. He was 16 years old when his mother made him join My Talent summer workshops headed by Trumpets Playshop founder and STAGES president Audie Gemora, to overcome his shyness. They eventually pushed him to audition for Star Magic.[13] Before being introduced to the media as a member of the Star Magic Circle Batch 16, he appeared in a series of TV commercials, including a Lewis and Pearl's advertisement, alongside Coleen Garcia.[14] He landed his first television role in the action-drama series Pieta where he played the character Harold.[11] Before Pieta, he had a cameo appearance in I Love Betty La Fea as one of the "Eco-models.
      In 2009, during the taping of Pieta, his mother convinced him to audition for the sitcom George and Cecil. As soon as head writer and director Jose Javier Reyes saw Gil, he immediately cast him to be on the show.[11] Later he was cast in the indie film Pitas as a brother of the lead character played by Kristel Moreno.[15]
      In 2010, he co-starred in the indie war film Diego and His Brothers.[15][16] He joined ASAP XV as one of Star Magic's "Gigger Boys" in April,[17] and in May, co-starred in the teleserye Rosalka, in which he played Andrew. He was originally set to appear in Kokey @ Ako,[18] but his character was written off in favor of Jason Francisco. In October, he was given the role of Joco, the younger brother of Paolo Barredo (Gerald Anderson), in the film Till My Heartaches End.[19] He got his first hosting stint in the ABS-CBN teen variety show Shoutout!. This was revamped and renamed to Shoutout!: Level Up, but the show was eventually cancelled due to poor ratings.[20]</p>
