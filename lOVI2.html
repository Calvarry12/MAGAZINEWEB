    <h2>Filipino Actress | Lovi Poe</h2>
    <p>Early and personal life
      Lourdes Virginia Moran Poe was born in St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City.[1] She was conceived from an affair between Filipino actors Fernando Poe Jr., who was married to Susan Roces, and Rowena Moran, who was his co-star in Kapag Puno Na ang Salop (1987). Poe was raised by Moran as a single mother. Growing up, she had spent limited time with her father in secret as she was raised abroad. She was publicly acknowledged by her father in 2004 during his presidential campaign.[1][9] Through her father, she has two older siblings, senator Grace and DJ Ronian, and through her mother, she has a younger sister, singer Mariel.[10][11] Although Roces knew about Lovi, Grace found out about Lovi during her father's campaign and the sisters met during their father's wake.[9]
      Poe finished high school at the Colegio San Agustin in Makati where she graduated in 2007. She then later took courses at the International Academy of Management and Economics and Miriam College.[12][13]
      Poe endorsed her sister Grace in the 2016 Philippine general election and the 2019 Philippine Senate election.[14][15]
      On August 26, 2023, Poe married British movie producer Monty Blencowe at Cliveden House near Berkshire, England. They announced their engagement publicly on August 8, 2023.[16]</p>
