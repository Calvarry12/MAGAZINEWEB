    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p>2000–2007: Early roles and breakthrough
      Locsin made her film debut as the young Robina Gokongwei in the 2000 biographical drama Ping Lacson: Super Cop.[11] She then signed a management deal with GMA Network and received her first television part as a series regular in the second season of the teen show Click.[9][12] She remained with the series from 2002 to 2004.[13] Locsin followed this with guest roles in several television shows, including Ang Iibigin ay Ikaw (2002), Twin Hearts (2003), and Love to Love (2003).[12][14] She appeared in the second and third installments of the Mano Po film franchise, Mano Po 2: My Home (2002) and Mano Po 3: My Love (2003).[15][16]    
      Locsin's breakthrough role came as the avian-human hybrid protagonist in the fantasy action series Mulawin (2004).[17] GMA Network executive Redgie Magno initially approached Maxene Magalona for the part, but offered Locsin the role at Magalona's suggestion.[18] Dominic Zapata, the show's director, intended the concept of mythology to be a "break from Tagalized soaps", but also kept its "novelty" focused on the lead characters.[17] The following year, Locsin starred as the titular superhero in the Ravelo Komiks Universe[a] series Darna (2005), based on Mars Ravelo's comics superheroine of the same name.[20] Locsin was initially hesitant about the part because it required her to drop out of Mulawin, and she felt the series would end prematurely if she left.[21] Locsin agreed to the project after network executives convinced her to take the part.[21] She trained in karate, wushu, and street fighting to prepare.[22] The series garnered positive reviews,[23][24][25] with praise for Locsin's portrayal; Nestor Torre Jr. of the Philippine Daily Inquirer described the production as modern and trailblazing,[23] and commended Locsin's "strong presence".[26] Similarly, Pepe Diokno, also from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, wrote that "the [show's] success can be attributed to [Locsin], as she attracts every block and wing of Pinoy society."[24] During its premiere, Darna received the highest Nielsen ratings for a Filipino television series pilot episode with a reported 47.1 percent viewership.[27] Later that year, Locsin reprised the role of Alwina in Mulawin's film adaptation.[28]
      In 2006, Locsin starred as a sorceress in the fantasy series Majika alongside Dennis Trillo.[29] In preparation for the part, she trained extensively in horseback riding with co-star and equestrienne Mikee Cojuangco-Jaworski.[30] The show was a critical disappointment;[31] Torre labeled it "less than magical":[32] "Unfortunately, the show is so visuals-driven that the gifted actors don't really have much opportunity to show what they can do."[32] Locsin was in three releases with Richard Gutierrez from 2006 to 2007. In the first, she starred in Mac Alejandre's romantic comedy I Will Always Love You as the love interest of Gutierrez's character.[33][34] She then appeared in the fifth installment of the Mano Po film series, Mano Po 5: Gua Ai Di (2006).[35] In the coming-of-age drama The Promise (2007), loosely based on Emily Brontë's 1847 novel Wuthering Heights,[36] Locsin portrayed a woman who falls in love with her adoptive brother.[36][37] The film and her performance received negative reviews from critics; the Philippine Daily Inquirer thought Locsin's transition to adult roles was rushed, "inadequate" and "embarrassing",[38] while critic Elyas Salanga found the film's narrative "typical" and "cliché".[37] Next, she was cast opposite Robin Padilla in the action adventure series Asian Treasures (2007).[39][40] She then played a facially disfigured victim of abuse in an episode of the anthology series Maalaala Mo Kaya.[41] Locsin's performance earned her a Star Award for Best Single Performance by an Actress.[42]</p>

    <h2>Early life and background</h2>
    <p>Angelica Locsin Colmenares was born on April 23, 1985, in Santa Maria, Bulacan, to Angelo and Emma Colmenares.[1][2] Locsin's father was a swimmer who earned a bronze medal when the Philippine team won the 4×200-meter freestyle relay during the 1954 Asian Games in Manila.[3][4] She has two younger siblings: Ella and Angelo.[1] Locsin is reluctant to publicly discuss her family background;[2] she was estranged from her mother until 2007,[2] and has ties to a noble family in Marawi, Lanao del Sur, through her maternal relatives.[5] Locsin and her siblings were raised by their father,[6] who was later diagnosed with complete blindness.[3][7] Locsin has said she regrets not being able to financially provide for her father's treatment at the onset of his condition.[7] She shares a close bond with her father and credits him as "instrumental" to her achievements.[3]
      Locsin was educated at the University of Santo Tomas High School, where she was a member of the varsity swimming team.[8] During this period, she was spotted running errands at SM City North EDSA by a talent scout, who arranged for her to audition for television commercials.[9] After high school, she pursued acting and attended workshops under ABS-CBN's talent management arm Star Magic. She then unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in the teen series G-mik (1999).[10]</p>
