    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>Anne Ojales Curtis-Smith[18] was born in Yarrawonga, Victoria, Australia, the daughter of Carmencita Ojales, a Filipino from Bolinao, Pangasinan and James Ernest Curtis-Smith, an Australian lawyer.[19] Her father married Ojales in 1982.[20] Her younger sister, Jasmine, is also an actress. On their father's side, they had a half-sister named Clare who died in 2007 due to a cardiovascular disease at four months old.[21]

      In 1997, at the age of 12, Curtis, who is half-Filipino, visited her mother's relatives in the Philippines with her family. During this trip, a talent scout approached her, inviting her to enter a children's beauty pageant. Despite initial skepticism from her father, Curtis, with her mother's support, decided to explore opportunities in the entertainment industry. Without her father's knowledge, she began attending various talent agencies. Eventually, the family made the decision to stay permanently in the Philippines. At the time, Curtis faced the challenge of not being able to speak or understand the Filipino language, prompting her to enroll in language classes.[1]</p>
